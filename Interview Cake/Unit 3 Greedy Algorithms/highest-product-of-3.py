# Given a list of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.

'''
We use a greedy â†´ approach to solve the problem in one pass. At each iteration we keep track of:

- highest_product_of_3
- highest_product_of_2
- highest
- lowest_product_of_2
- lowest

Two negative numbers make a positive.

1. the current highest_product_of_3
2. current * highest_product_of_2
3. current * lowest_product_of_2

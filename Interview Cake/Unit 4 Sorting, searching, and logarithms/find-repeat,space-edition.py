# Find a duplicate, Space Edition

'''
We have a list of integers, where:

The integers are in the range 1..n
The list has a length of n+1

It follows that our list has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have several duplicates, 
and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

Write a function which finds an integer that 
appears more than once in our list.

1. Find the number of integers in our input list which lie within the range 1..n/2 
2. Compare that to the number of possible unique integers in the same range
3. If the number of actual integers is greater than the number of possible integers, 
we know thereâ€™s a duplicate in the range 1..n/2, so we iteratively use the same approach on that range
4. If the number of actual integers is not greater than the number of possible integers, we know 
there must be duplicate in the range n/2 + 1..n, so we iteratively use the same approach on that range
5. At some point, our range will contain just 1 integer, which will be our answer
